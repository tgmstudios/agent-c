    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <p>I'm Aiden Johnson, a passionate Software Developer with a talent for blending technical innovation and teamwork to solve complex problems. My journey started with a simple fascination for technology and has grown into years of hands-on experience across full-stack development, RFID solutions, and cybersecurity infrastructure.

    I‚Äôm currently pursuing Computer Science at Penn State University, while balancing a multifaceted career at Telaeris, Inc. and leading technical initiatives for the Penn State Competitive Cybersecurity Organization. My professional highlights include leading large-scale RFID tracking projects, pioneering web solutions, and enhancing business-critical systems that streamline operations.

    When I‚Äôm not coding, I‚Äôm likely experimenting with machine learning, enhancing my containerization skills, or diving into tech competitions. From collaborating with geographically diverse teams to building products that impact daily lives, I thrive at the intersection of innovation and impact.</p>
