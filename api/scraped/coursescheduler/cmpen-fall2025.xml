CMPEN 111S Computers and Computer Hardware (1)This course contains two components: an orientation to University life and an introduction to the hardware aspects of computer engineering. In the orientation to University life, students learn about the responsibilities of and expectations on a student including ethical behavior, and explore some of the academic and non-academic resources of the University. In the introduction to computer engineering students learn about some of the fundamental concepts, devices, and methodologies that are involved in the design and use of digital and computer hardware. This exploration begins with a foundation of logic and critical thinking. Logic is examined first from a theoretical problem solving standpoint. The discussion then progresses to an implementation perspective examining how logic devices are created and used. Included is a look at some CAD tools and some logic design laboratory exercises. Using logic as a basic building block, the organization and design of a computer is then examined, ending in an exploration of some of the contemporary methods used to make computers faster and more efficient.","enrollmentStatus":null,"fees":"","freeFormTopics":"","freeTextbookIndicated":"N","lowCostTextbookIndicated":"N","id":"10803","instructionMode":"In Person","location":"University Park Campus","lrnComTitle":null,"notes":"","notesShort":"","partsOfTerm":"Regular Academic Session","prerequisites":"","registrationNumber":"10803","registrationType":"E","requirementDesignationDescr":"","seatsCapacity":"35","seatsFilled":"0","sectionNumber":"001","sectionStatus":"OPEN","subject":"Computer Engineering","subjectId":"CMPEN","textbook":"","title":"Computer Hardware","topicTitle":"","waitlist":"0","waitlistOpen":"5","waitlistPosition":null,"openLearningRegistrationStart":null,"openLearningRegistrationEnd":null},{"approval":"","approvalCode":"","hasCorequisites":false,"hasFreetextbook":false,"hasLowCostTextbook":false,"hasPrerequisites":false,"hasReserveCaps":false,"hasRestrictions":false,"hasSectionCorequisites":false,"hasSectionNotes":false,"isExternal":false,"isHonors":false,"isOnline":false,"isWritingEnhanced":false,"optional":false,"registrationClosed":false,"lastWaitListDate":"2025-08-30T00:00:00","partOfTermBeginDate":"2025-08-25T00:00:00","registrationEnds":"2025-12-12T00:00:00","creditsMax":1.0,"creditsMin":1.0,"openSeats":35,"topicId":null,"institutionCode":"PSU55","institution":null,"institutionAbbreviation":null,"sectionAttributes":[{"id":"FYE-FYS","attrTitle":"First-Year Engagement Program","attr":"FYE","valueTitle":"First-Year Seminar","value":"FYS","attrDescription":null}],"corequisiteSections":[],"enrollmentRequirements":[{"type":"Assoc","description":"Students must meet semester classifications 001-002"}],"exams":[],"instructor":[{"id":"2397","name":"John Sampson","email":"jms1257@psu.edu","externalId":"952901052","instructorRole":"PI"}],"meetings":[{"days":"T","daysRaw":"T","startTime":1505,"endTime":1620,"location":"Walker Building 003","meetingType":"LEC","startDate":"2025-08-26T00:00:00Z","endDate":"2025-12-09T00:00:00Z","mapURL":"http://www.google.com/maps/place/40.7932534,-77.8668708","meetingTypeDescription":null,"scheduleTypeCode":null,"scheduleTypeDescription":null,"building":"Walker Building 003","buildingDescription":"Walker Building","buildingCode":"0504000","room":"003","firstMonday":"2025-08-25T00:00:00Z","lastMonday":"2025-12-08T00:00:00Z"}],"reserveCaps":[],"courseRestrictions":[],"sectionRestrictions":[],"disabledReasons":[],"flags":[],"linkedSectionRegNumbers":null,"textbooks":[],"registrationOptions":{"gradingBases":[{"code":"GRD","description":null}],"showInstructorOptions":false,"showPermissionNumberOption":true,"showRequirementDesignationOption":false,"showStartDateOption":false},"academicCareer":"UGRD","academicCareerDescr":"Undergraduate","academicCareerDescrShort":"Undergrad","academicGroup":"EN","academicGroupDescr":"Engineering","campus":"University Park","campusCode":"UP","campusDescription":"University Park","campusDescriptionRaw":"University Park","campusShort":null,"classAssociations":"","component":"LEC","corequisites":"","course":"111","courseAttributes":"First-Year Seminar","credits":"1","customData":"</br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong> Textbooks: </strong><a href = 'https://psu.bncollege.com/webapp/wcs/stores/servlet/TBListView?cm_mmc=RI-_-999-_-1-_-A&amp;catalogId=10001&amp;storeId=18555&amp;langId=-1&amp;termMapping=N&amp;courseXml=<?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"UTF-8\"?><textbookorder><campus name=\"UP\"><school id=\"435\"/><courses><course dept=\"CMPEN\" num=\"111\" sect=\"002\" term=\"F25\" /></courses></campus></textbookorder>' target='_blank'>Click Here</a>","department":"UPEN_CSE","description":"A brief orientation to University life and resources and an introduction to computers and computer hardware.

The course introduces the theoretical foundation for digital systems including number systems, a variety of commonly used codes and Boolean algebra. Combinational devices, logic gates, and sequential devices, latches and flip-flops are introduced along with design techniques, methods and tools. Design criteria and objectives are considered and design trade-offs are examined. Higher level design elements are also examined such as decoders, multiplexers, counters, and registers, and their use in system design. Students are exposed to a variety of design tools and implementation techniques, including schematic capture tools, simulation tools, Hardware Description Languages (HDL) and HDL design tools.

CMPEN 362CMPEN (E E) 362 Communication Networks (3)CMPEN (E E) 362 is an elective course in both the electrical and computer engineering curricula which provides an overview of the broad field of data and computer communications. First, a general model of the communication task is presented, including the layered concept by which each layer provides services for the layer above. First, the lowest (physical) layer is studied. This involves signal design, Fourier analysis representations, bandwidth concepts, transmission impairments and communication media properties. Then the next higher (link) layer is considered which involves organizing bits into frames, data link and error control methods (including frame sequence numbering and error detection principles). Multiplexing to share a link is studied, including frequency division multiplexing, dedicated time division multiplexing, and statistical time multiplexing.At the network layer level, there are two categories: broadcast (usually local area) and switching networks.

CMPEN 362CMPEN (E E) 362 Communication Networks (3)CMPEN (E E) 362 is an elective course in both the electrical and computer engineering curricula which provides an overview of the broad field of data and computer communications. First, a general model of the communication task is presented, including the layered concept by which each layer provides services for the layer above. First, the lowest (physical) layer is studied. This involves signal design, Fourier analysis representations, bandwidth concepts, transmission impairments and communication media properties. Then the next higher (link) layer is considered which involves organizing bits into frames, data link and error control methods (including frame sequence numbering and error detection principles). Multiplexing to share a link is studied, including frequency division multiplexing, dedicated time division multiplexing, and statistical time multiplexing.At the network layer level, there are two categories: broadcast (usually local area) and switching networks. Broadcast and local area network studies include bus, tree and star topologies, Ethernet, optical fiber bus networks, ring networks, and medium access control protocols.Switching and routing concepts for networks are explained, including both circuit and packet switching, datagrams and virtual circuits. Properties of frame relay and asynchronous transfer mode (ATM) networks are described. Internetworking frame structures, routing and protocols are studied.

CMPEN 416CMPEN 416 Digital Integrated Circuits (3)CMPEN 416 is a technical elective available to electrical and computer engineering students. It is intended for students who wish to specialize in the field of digital circuits. This course introduces the basic concepts involved in the design of digital circuits, which find practical application as logic and memory circuits in computers and other digital processing systems. The course emphasizes integrated circuit process-compatible circuit design techniques in recognition of the amazing synergy that has characterized the relationship between computer circuits and integrated circuit processing technology. This course includes three lectures and a two-hour laboratory each week. The only prerequisite is E E 310, a basic circuits course required for both electrical engineering and computer engineering students.CMPEN 416 begins with a review of the bipolar junction transistor (BJT) device and proceeds into the more advanced Ebers-Moll device model. This is followed by an examination of a series of BJT-based saturating and non-saturating digital circuits of ever increasing complexity illustrating the evolution of the modern bipolar logic circuit families. The next phase of the course reviews the metal oxide semiconductor field effect transistor (MOSFET) and proceeds along the same path taken for the bipolar transistor circuits. Various MOSFET logic circuit families are introduced and analyzed. Computer semiconductor memory circuits are considered next. Both BJT and MOSFET versions of both static and dynamic read-write and read-only memories are considered. The cell array, memory addressing circuits, and sense amplifier designs are all examined in detail. This is followed by the related subject of programmable logic arrays, the final topic.The emphasis of the laboratory component of the course is to compare the performance of representatives of each class of circuits to computer simulations of the same circuits. Parameters such as input-output voltage transfer characteristics, noise margins, and propagation delays are evaluated by building and measuring laboratory models. Most of the laboratory exercises require the student to evaluate a specified circuit, but the final exercise requires the student to design a circuit to meet a predefined set of specifications, then to prove that the design meets the requirements by measuring the circuit performance. Students are required to write a formal engineering report detailing the results of each laboratory exercise.","enrollmentStatus":null,"fees":"","freeFormTopics":"","freeTextbookIndicated":"N","lowCostTextbookIndicated":"N","id":"10280","instructionMode":"In Person","location":"University Park Campus","lrnComTitle":null,"notes":"","notesShort":"","partsOfTerm":"Regular Academic Session","prerequisites":"","registrationNumber":"10280","registrationType":"E","requirementDesignationDescr":"","seatsCapacity":"48","seatsFilled":"11","sectionNumber":"001","sectionStatus":"OPEN","subject":"Computer Engineering","subjectId":"CMPEN","textbook":"","title":"Dig Integrated Crt","topicTitle":"","waitlist":"0","waitlistOpen":"5","waitlistPosition":null,"openLearningRegistrationStart":null,"openLearningRegistrationEnd":null}]}]]></response>

CMPEN 454CMPEN 454 Fundamentals of Computer Vision (3)CMPEN 454 is an introduction to computer vision. The goal of computer vision is to make computers understand and interpret visual information. Computer vision systems bring together imaging devices, computers, and sophisticated algorithms for solving problems in areas such as industrial inspection, medicine, document analysis, autonomous navigation, and remote sensing. The course involves both pedagogical written assignments and computer projects.The beginning of the course gives an overview of computer vision and introduces low level image analysis techniques for binary images. Binary vision systems are useful when the silhouette of imaged objects convey enough information to recognize them. Examples can be found in optical character recognition, chromosome analysis and recognition of industrial parts. Moreover, many techniques developed for binary systems can be applied to gray level or color images. Next, the course covers image segmentation and contours. These topics are the foundation of most computer vision techniques. For an image to be correctly interpreted, it must be partitioned into regions that correspond to distinct objects or parts of objects. First, region based techniques such as thresholding, split and merge, region growing and texture analysis are introduced. Next, edge based techniques using gradient and Laplacian operators are discussed. Finally, contour representations and curve approximations linking edges into region boundaries are studied.Next, depth from vision, with emphasis in stereo vision, is considered. Calculating distances to and among various points in the scene is important in many computer vision tasks such as inspection, robot manipulation, and autonomous navigation. In this part of the course the geometry of stereo systems and how to obtain depth maps from stereo image pairs is studied. Also, alternative 3D imaging sensors such as laser based range finders and radars are discussed.Following stereo, the topic of computer vision is broaden to understand sequences of images over time. In this section techniques using information on spatial and temporal changes are used to design computer vision systems capable of coping with moving and changing objects, changing illumination and changing viewpoints. Visual motion is important primarily for two reasons. First, motion is a very important cue to understand the scene structure. Second, biological systems do use motion to infer properties of the surrounding world with very little a priori knowledge.Finally, the topic of 3D object recognition is discussed. Object recognition entails two main issues: object identification and object localization. Identification determines the objects being imaged while localization determines their position in the world and with respect to the sensors. This topic builds upon all the different techniques discussed until this point.","enrollmentStatus":null,"fees":"","freeFormTopics":"","freeTextbookIndicated":"N","lowCostTextbookIndicated":"N","id":"10302","instructionMode":"In Person","location":"University Park Campus","lrnComTitle":null,"notes":"","notesShort":"","partsOfTerm":"Regular Academic Session","prerequisites":"","registrationNumber":"10302","registrationType":"E","requirementDesignationDescr":"","seatsCapacity":"130","seatsFilled":"46","sectionNumber":"001","sectionStatus":"OPEN","subject":"Computer Engineering","subjectId":"CMPEN","textbook":"","title":"Computer Vision I","topicTitle":"","waitlist":"0","waitlistOpen":"15","waitlistPosition":null,"openLearningRegistrationStart":null,"openLearningRegistrationEnd":null}]}]]></response>

The course explores the process of translating a problem statement into an effective and economical computer system that meets the needs of the customer. Topics include a comparison of popular process models, analysis and derivation of requirements, requirements allocation and flow down, the work breakdown structure, object-oriented analysis and modeling, the design and development of the user interface, reliability engineering, scheduling, costing, and ethics. Communication skills are developed through oral presentations and a sequence of writing assignments, beginning with a description of requirements and leading to a final design document.CMPEN 482W is not a prerequisite for any other course.CMPEN 482W requires access to PCs or Unix workstations having a C++ compiler. Other specialty hardware or software may be required on a semester-by-semester basis.","enrollmentStatus":null,"fees":"","freeFormTopics":"","freeTextbookIndicated":"N","lowCostTextbookIndicated":"N","id":"10802","instructionMode":"In Person","location":"University Park Campus","lrnComTitle":null,"notes":"","notesShort":"","partsOfTerm":"Regular Academic Session","prerequisites":"","registrationNumber":"10802","registrationType":"E","requirementDesignationDescr":"","seatsCapacity":"36","seatsFilled":"13","sectionNumber":"001","sectionStatus":"OPEN","subject":"Computer Engineering","subjectId":"CMPEN","textbook":"","title":"Cse Project Dsgn","topicTitle":"","waitlist":"0","waitlistOpen":"10","waitlistPosition":null,"openLearningRegistrationStart":null,"openLearningRegistrationEnd":null}]}]]></response>
