testing, and evaluation of basic computer programs. The concepts include basic computational constructs such as calculation, iteration, conditions, functions, and data types. These provide the basic building blocks found in virtually all programming languages. The processes include the step-by-step refinement of a problem description into individual components that can be implemented, tested, and integrated into an effective solution.As a general education course, the central theme to the course is computational thinking which includes a wide range of approaches to solving problems and designing systems that draw upon concepts fundamental to computer science. Computational thinking includes thinking about various types and sources of data, and the correctness, efficiency, elegance, and simplicity of various potential solutions. Computational thinking is applying principles of abstraction at multiple levels to focus on important details; it is applying problem decomposition to identify small problems that can be individually solved then combined to form a solution to the original problem.Upon completion of this course, the student will be able to conceptualize and implement computational solutions to problems; to utilize the imperative model of computation to solve problems; to reason about problems at multiple levels of abstraction; and to analyze code for its behavior, efficiency, and correctness.A student may receive credit for only one of the following courses: CMPSC 101, CMPSC 121, CMPSC 131, CMPSC 200, CMPSC 201","enrollmentStatus":null,"fees":"","freeFormTopics":"","freeTextbookIndicated":"N","lowCostTextbookIndicated":"N","id":"10350","instructionMode":"In Person","location":"Altoona Campus","lrnComTitle":null,"notes":"","notesShort":"","partsOfTerm":"Regular Academic Session","prerequisites":"","registrationNumber":"10350","registrationType":"E","requirementDesignationDescr":"","seatsCapacity":"25","seatsFilled":"0","sectionNumber":"001","sectionStatus":"OPEN","subject":"Computer Science","subjectId":"CMPSC","textbook":"","title":"Intro Programming","topicTitle":"","waitlist":"0","waitlistOpen":"5","waitlistPosition":null,"openLearningRegistrationStart":null,"openLearningRegistrationEnd":null},{"approval":"","approvalCode":"","hasCorequisites":false,"hasFreetextbook":false,"hasLowCostTextbook":false,"hasPrerequisites":false,"hasReserveCaps":false,"hasRestrictions":false,"hasSectionCorequisites":false,"hasSectionNotes":false,"isExternal":false,"isHonors":false,"isOnline":false,"isWritingEnhanced":false,"optional":false,"registrationClosed":false,"lastWaitListDate":"2025-08-30T00:00:00","partOfTermBeginDate":"2025-08-25T00:00:00","registrationEnds":"2025-12-12T00:00:00","creditsMax":3.0,"creditsMin":3.0,"openSeats":23,"topicId":null,"institutionCode":"PSU55","institution":null,"institutionAbbreviation":null,"sectionAttributes":[{"id":"B.A.-QUANT","attrTitle":"Bachelor of Arts","attr":"B.A.","valueTitle":"BA: Quantification","value":"QUANT","attrDescription":null},{"id":"GE-GQ","attrTitle":"General Education","attr":"GE","valueTitle":"GenEd: Quantification (GQ)","value":"GQ","attrDescription":null}],"corequisiteSections":[],"enrollmentRequirements":[{"type":"Offer","description":"Enforced Prerequisite: MATH 21 or satisfactory performance on the mathematics placement examination."}],"exams":[],"instructor":[{"id":"929","name":"Curtis Minich","email":"clm16@psu.edu","externalId":"964673191","instructorRole":"PI"}],"meetings":[{"days":"R","daysRaw":"R","startTime":1530,"endTime":1755,"location":"Gaige Tech-Bus Innov Bldg 209","meetingType":"LEC","startDate":"2025-08-28T00:00:00Z","endDate":"2025-12-11T00:00:00Z","mapURL":"http://www.google.com/maps/place/40.3592864,-75.9742551","meetingTypeDescription":null,"scheduleTypeCode":null,"scheduleTypeDescription":null,"building":"Gaige Tech-Bus Innov Bldg 209","buildingDescription":"Gaige Tech-Bus Innov Bldg","buildingCode":"0980079","room":"209","firstMonday":"2025-08-25T00:00:00Z","lastMonday":"2025-12-08T00:00:00Z"}],"reserveCaps":[],"courseRestrictions":[],"sectionRestrictions":[],"disabledReasons":["The campus \"Berks\" is not selected."],"flags":[],"linkedSectionRegNumbers":null,"textbooks":[],"registrationOptions":{"gradingBases":[{"code":"GRD","description":null}],"showInstructorOptions":false,"showPermissionNumberOption":true,"showRequirementDesignationOption":false,"showStartDateOption":false},"academicCareer":"UGRD","academicCareerDescr":"Undergraduate","academicCareerDescrShort":"Undergrad","academicGroup":"EN","academicGroupDescr":"Engineering","campus":"Berks","campusCode":"BK","campusDescription":"Berks","campusDescriptionRaw":"Berks","campusShort":null,"classAssociations":"","component":"LEC","corequisites":"","course":"101","courseAttributes":"BA: Quantification, GenEd: Quantification (GQ)","credits":"3","customData":"</br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong> Textbooks: </strong><a href = 'https://psu.bncollege.com/webapp/wcs/stores/servlet/TBListView?cm_mmc=RI-_-999-_-1-_-A&amp;catalogId=10001&amp;storeId=18560&amp;langId=-1&amp;termMapping=N&amp;courseXml=<?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"UTF-8\"?><textbookorder><campus name=\"BK\"><school id=\"440\"/><courses><course dept=\"CMPSC\" num=\"101\" sect=\"001\" term=\"F25\" /></courses></campus></textbookorder>' target='_blank'>Click Here</a>","department":"BK","description":"This course introduces the fundamental concepts and processes of solving computational problems through the design, implementation, testing, and evaluation of basic computer programs.

Computational thinking is applying principles of abstraction at multiple levels to focus on important details; it is applying problem decomposition to identify small problems that can be individually solved then combined to form a solution to the original problem.Upon completion of this course, the student will be able to conceptualize and implement computational solutions to problems; to utilize the imperative model of computation to solve problems; to reason about problems at multiple levels of abstraction; and to analyze code for its behavior, efficiency, and correctness.A student may receive credit for only one of the following courses: CMPSC 101, CMPSC 121, CMPSC 131, CMPSC 200, CMPSC 201","enrollmentStatus":null,"fees":"","freeFormTopics":"","freeTextbookIndicated":"N","lowCostTextbookIndicated":"N","id":"11196","instructionMode":"In Person","location":"University Park Campus","lrnComTitle":null,"notes":"","notesShort":"","partsOfTerm":"Regular Academic Session","prerequisites":"","registrationNumber":"11196","registrationType":"N","requirementDesignationDescr":"","seatsCapacity":"55","seatsFilled":"1","sectionNumber":"001R","sectionStatus":"OPEN","subject":"Computer Science","subjectId":"CMPSC","textbook":"","title":"Intro Programming","topicTitle":"","waitlist":"0","waitlistOpen":"10","waitlistPosition":null,"openLearningRegistrationStart":null,"openLearningRegistrationEnd":null},{"approval":"","approvalCode":"","hasCorequisites":false,"hasFreetextbook":false,"hasLowCostTextbook":false,"hasPrerequisites":false,"hasReserveCaps":false,"hasRestrictions":false,"hasSectionCorequisites":false,"hasSectionNotes":false,"isExternal":false,"isHonors":false,"isOnline":false,"isWritingEnhanced":false,"optional":false,"registrationClosed":false,"lastWaitListDate":"2025-08-30T00:00:00","partOfTermBeginDate":"2025-08-25T00:00:00","registrationEnds":"2025-12-12T00:00:00","creditsMax":3.0,"creditsMin":3.0,"openSeats":24,"topicId":null,"institutionCode":"PSU55","institution":null,"institutionAbbreviation":null,"sectionAttributes":[{"id":"B.A.-QUANT","attrTitle":"Bachelor of Arts","attr":"B.A.","valueTitle":"BA: Quantification","value":"QUANT","attrDescription":null},{"id":"GE-GQ","attrTitle":"General Education","attr":"GE","valueTitle":"GenEd: Quantification (GQ)","value":"GQ","attrDescription":null}],"corequisiteSections":[],"enrollmentRequirements":[{"type":"Offer","description":"Enforced Prerequisite: MATH 21 or satisfactory performance on the mathematics placement examination."}],"exams":[],"instructor":[{"id":"48678983","name":"Daniel Blessner","email":"djb111@psu.edu","externalId":"989038304","instructorRole":"PI"}],"meetings":[{"days":"TR","daysRaw":"TR","startTime":1335,"endTime":1450,"location":"Bell Atlantic Building 020","meetingType":"LEC","startDate":"2025-08-26T00:00:00Z","endDate":"2025-12-11T00:00:00Z","mapURL":"http://www.google.com/maps/place/41.3075559,-76.0175106","meetingTypeDescription":null,"scheduleTypeCode":null,"scheduleTypeDescription":null,"building":"Bell Atlantic Building 020","buildingDescription":"Bell Atlantic Building","buildingCode":"0983010","room":"020","firstMonday":"2025-08-25T00:00:00Z","lastMonday":"2025-12-08T00:00:00Z"}],"reserveCaps":[],"courseRestrictions":[],"sectionRestrictions":[],"disabledReasons":["The campus \"Wilkes-Barre\" is not selected."],"flags":[],"linkedSectionRegNumbers":null,"textbooks":[],"registrationOptions":{"gradingBases":[{"code":"GRD","description":null}],"showInstructorOptions":false,"showPermissionNumberOption":true,"showRequirementDesignationOption":false,"showStartDateOption":false},"academicCareer":"UGRD","academicCareerDescr":"Undergraduate","academicCareerDescrShort":"Undergrad","academicGroup":"EN","academicGroupDescr":"Engineering","campus":"Wilkes-Barre","campusCode":"WB","campusDescription":"Wilkes-Barre","campusDescriptionRaw":"Wilkes-Barre","campusShort":null,"classAssociations":"","component":"LEC","corequisites":"","course":"101","courseAttributes":"BA: Quantification, GenEd: Quantification (GQ)","credits":"3","customData":"</br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong> Textbooks: </strong><a href = 'https://psu.bncollege.com/webapp/wcs/stores/servlet/TBListView?cm_mmc=RI-_-999-_-1-_-A&amp;catalogId=10001&amp;storeId=18569&amp;langId=-1&amp;termMapping=N&amp;courseXml=<?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"UTF-8\"?><textbookorder><campus name=\"WB\"><school id=\"454\"/><courses><course dept=\"CMPSC\" num=\"101\" sect=\"001\" term=\"F25\" /></courses></campus></textbookorder>' target='_blank'>Click Here</a>","department":"UCWB","description":"This course introduces the fundamental concepts and processes of solving computational problems through the design, implementation, testing, and evaluation of basic computer programs.

Computational thinking includes thinking recursively, considering parallel processing, thinking about types and type checking, judging a program not just for correctness and efficiency but also for its esthetics, and judging a system design for its simplicity and elegance. Computational thinking is applying principles of abstraction at multiple levels to focus on important details; it is applying problem decomposition to identify small problems that can be individually solved then combined to form a solution to the original problem.

control structures, functions, plotting, and basic numerical analysis techniques, all in the context of science and engineering. The course enables students to develop computer programs in a scientific programming language to solve simple engineering and science problems. The basic numerical analysis techniques covered in the course include matrix operations, systems of equations, solving equations, roots, curve fitting, interpolation, numerical integration, and numerical solutions of ordinary differential equations. Students analyze engineering and science problems, develop algorithms to solve those problems, implement their algorithms in an appropriate programming language, and produce informative output in both numerical and graphical form. The general programming concepts learned in the course are commonly found in most programming languages. The problem-solving skills learned in the course can then be utilized in upper-level engineering and science courses. This course includes an exploration of the conceptual and syntactical background needed for the successful completion of practical programming assignments. The course also includes an emphasis on the actual design and implementation of computer programs necessary for solving computational problems.

The course enables students to develop computer programs in a scientific programming language to solve simple engineering and science problems. The basic numerical analysis techniques covered in the course include matrix operations, systems of equations, solving equations, roots, curve fitting, interpolation, numerical integration, and numerical solutions of ordinary differential equations. Students analyze engineering and science problems, develop algorithms to solve those problems, implement their algorithms in an appropriate programming language, and produce informative output in both numerical and graphical form. The general programming concepts learned in the course are commonly found in most programming languages. The problem-solving skills learned in the course can then be utilized in upper-level engineering and science courses. This course includes an exploration of the conceptual and syntactical background needed for the successful completion of practical programming assignments. The course also includes an emphasis on the actual design and implementation of computer programs necessary for solving computational problems. This course satisfies University quantification requirements because it assists students in assessing and interpreting quantitative data and information. In addition, the course assists students with recognizing patterns, establishing relations, exercising conceptual thinking, developing problem-solving skills, and thinking logically and critically.

The basic numerical analysis techniques covered in the course include matrix operations, systems of equations, solving equations, roots, curve fitting, interpolation, numerical integration, and numerical solutions of ordinary differential equations. Students analyze engineering and science problems, develop algorithms to solve those problems, implement their algorithms in an appropriate programming language, and produce informative output in both numerical and graphical form. The general programming concepts learned in the course are commonly found in most programming languages. The problem-solving skills learned in the course can then be utilized in upper-level engineering and science courses. This course includes an exploration of the conceptual and syntactical background needed for the successful completion of practical programming assignments. The course also includes an emphasis on the actual design and implementation of computer programs necessary for solving computational problems. This course satisfies University quantification requirements because it assists students in assessing and interpreting quantitative data and information. In addition, the course assists students with recognizing patterns, establishing relations, exercising conceptual thinking, developing problem-solving skills, and thinking logically and critically. Finally, the course supports students in their efforts to draw accurate and useful conclusions, to make informed decisions based on quantitative analysis, and to use mathematical skills to solve conceptual problems.

Students analyze engineering and science problems, develop algorithms to solve those problems, implement their algorithms in an appropriate programming language, and produce informative output in both numerical and graphical form. The general programming concepts learned in the course are commonly found in most programming languages. The problem-solving skills learned in the course can then be utilized in upper-level engineering and science courses. This course includes an exploration of the conceptual and syntactical background needed for the successful completion of practical programming assignments. The course also includes an emphasis on the actual design and implementation of computer programs necessary for solving computational problems. This course satisfies University quantification requirements because it assists students in assessing and interpreting quantitative data and information. In addition, the course assists students with recognizing patterns, establishing relations, exercising conceptual thinking, developing problem-solving skills, and thinking logically and critically. Finally, the course supports students in their efforts to draw accurate and useful conclusions, to make informed decisions based on quantitative analysis, and to use mathematical skills to solve conceptual problems.

The emphasis of the course is on computation as a problem-solving tool for highly mathematical intensive applications. The course includes the study of core programming concepts, including data types, data structures, control structures, functions, and problem decomposition, and then continues with techniques applicable to modeling and visualizing scientific data. Students gain experience solving scientific and engineering problems by translating mathematical specifications into computational solutions, using a variety of mathematical and related libraries. They also gain experience developing solutions that provide visual representations of the results.","enrollmentStatus":null,"fees":"","freeFormTopics":"","freeTextbookIndicated":"N","lowCostTextbookIndicated":"N","id":"12591","instructionMode":"In Person","location":"University Park Campus","lrnComTitle":null,"notes":"","notesShort":"","partsOfTerm":"Regular Academic Session","prerequisites":"","registrationNumber":"12591","registrationType":"E","requirementDesignationDescr":"","seatsCapacity":"75","seatsFilled":"5","sectionNumber":"001","sectionStatus":"OPEN","subject":"Computer Science","subjectId":"CMPSC","textbook":"","title":"Intro Comp Sci Programming","topicTitle":"","waitlist":"0","waitlistOpen":"20","waitlistPosition":null,"openLearningRegistrationStart":null,"openLearningRegistrationEnd":null}]}]]></response>

CMPSC 311 CMPSC 311 Introduction to Systems Programming (3) System Programming concerns the development of software components and methods for their combination, independent of any particular application. This course will provide information and experience required to understand, design and implement components of large software systems.In general, students should be able to evaluate design alternatives according to standard practice, specifications, performance analysis, robustness, etc. To concentrate attention, we investigate one system and one programming language in detail, through demonstration programs, short- and long-term programming assignments. The specific system is Unix, a family of operating systems forming a complete standardized programming environment based on the idea of software tools. The specific language is C, which is widely used for operating system implementations, and which forms the basis for the C++ and Java languages studied in the prerequisite courses.

The course covers extensively the design of algorithms and implementations of software solutions to various exploratory data mining tasks. In addition, we discuss in depth various requirements and technical issues arising in the design and implementations of robust, efficient, effective and scalable software solutions. Topics covered include types and quality of data, similarity measures of data, algorithms and approaches for data processing/cleaning/analysis, data exploration, cluster analysis, association analysis, and anomaly detection. Additionally, basic concepts and techniques for predictive data mining, i.e., regression and classification, are reviewed. Students will exercise the obtained knowledge to address important technical issues in realistic exploratory data mining tasks and applications. Because the knowledge of various data structures (e.g., index structures, hash trees, graphs, lattices, and pointers) and algorithmic concepts (e.g., recursions, traversal, and pruning) are essential background to many data mining algorithms taught in the course. Students who are interested in the course are required to take the prerequisite courses in order to equip themselves with appropriate background knowledge and programming skillsets to succeed in the course.","enrollmentStatus":null,"fees":"","freeFormTopics":"","freeTextbookIndicated":"N","lowCostTextbookIndicated":"N","id":"12641","instructionMode":"In Person","location":"University Park Campus","lrnComTitle":null,"notes":"","notesShort":"","partsOfTerm":"Regular Academic Session","prerequisites":"","registrationNumber":"12641","registrationType":"E","requirementDesignationDescr":"","seatsCapacity":"70","seatsFilled":"8","sectionNumber":"001","sectionStatus":"OPEN","subject":"Computer Science","subjectId":"CMPSC","textbook":"","title":"Exploratory Data Mining","topicTitle":"","waitlist":"0","waitlistOpen":"10","waitlistPosition":null,"openLearningRegistrationStart":null,"openLearningRegistrationEnd":null}]}]]></response>

The goal of this course is for students to develop debugging skills through extensive practice. The course will cover general methodologies for debugging such as instrumentation, consistency checking, and divide & conquer. The course will also cover how to effectively utilize a variety of debugging tools such as debuggers, memory error detectors, race condition detectors, etc. Lastly, the course will explain specific types of bugs such as race conditions, deadlocks, and corrupted memory, which is necessary for finding these types of bugs. This is a project-based course that will involve extensive reading and writing of C code and use of Linux, so a solid background knowledge in C and Linux is expected.","enrollmentStatus":null,"fees":"","freeFormTopics":"","freeTextbookIndicated":"N","lowCostTextbookIndicated":"N","id":"12640","instructionMode":"In Person","location":"University Park Campus","lrnComTitle":null,"notes":"","notesShort":"","partsOfTerm":"Regular Academic Session","prerequisites":"","registrationNumber":"12640","registrationType":"E","requirementDesignationDescr":"","seatsCapacity":"75","seatsFilled":"3","sectionNumber":"001","sectionStatus":"OPEN","subject":"Computer Science","subjectId":"CMPSC","textbook":"","title":"Systems Debugging","topicTitle":"","waitlist":"0","waitlistOpen":"10","waitlistPosition":null,"openLearningRegistrationStart":null,"openLearningRegistrationEnd":null}]}]]></response>
